C++ Program to Count Even and Odd Numbers in a Range with Intervals

 Description

This C++ program allows the user to input a starting number, an ending number, and an interval. The program will then iterate from the starting number to the ending number, increasing by the given interval each time. For each number in the range, it will check whether it is even or odd, count the total even and odd numbers, and store the list of even and odd numbers in separate strings. Finally, the program will print the lists of even and odd numbers along with their counts.

Features
- The program allows the user to specify the starting number, the ending number, and the interval for iteration.
- The program will count and print the total number of even and odd numbers in the specified range.
- It will display both the list of even and odd numbers.
- It works for both even and odd intervals.

Example

- Enter the starting number: 48
- Enter the end number: 137
- Enter the intervals: 7
- 48 is even
- 55 is odd
- 62 is even
- 69 is odd
- 76 is even
- 83 is odd
- 90 is even
- 97 is odd
- 104 is even
- 111 is odd
- 118 is even
- 125 is odd
- 132 is even
- Even numbers: 48. 62. 76. 90. 104. 118. 132.
- Total even numbers: 7
- Odd numbers: 55. 69. 83. 97. 111. 125.
- Total odd numbers: 6
